# boiler-room-v46

This project is a simple notes application that allows users to create, display, and delete notes. 
Hereâ€™s a summary of its main features:

<h3>Initialization:</h3> The application loads existing notes from localStorage when the window is opened, ensuring any previously saved notes are displayed.
<h3>Local Storage Handling:</h3>
It retrieves notes from localStorage, handling any potential errors (e.g., corrupted data) by resetting to an empty array if necessary.
<h3>Input Validation:</h3>
Users can only add notes with unique titles. If a duplicate title is entered, an error message is displayed.
The application checks that the title and content fields are not empty or only whitespace before allowing a note to be added.
<h3>Adding Notes:</h3>
When the user submits a new note, it constructs a note object (including title, content, and date) and updates the localStorage.
<h3>Displaying Notes:</h3>
Notes are dynamically displayed in a container. If there are no notes, a message indicates that no notes are available.
<h3>Deleting Notes:</h3>
Each note has a delete icons. Clicking the delete icon removes the note from both the display and localStorage.
<h3>Search Functionality:</h3>
Users can filter notes by title using a search input. If the search term matches any note titles, only those notes are displayed.
<h3>User Interaction:</h3>
Users can expand or collapse the content of notes for a cleaner interface.

Overall, this code provides the core functionality for a basic notes management application, enabling users to manage their notes efficiently while utilizing localStorage for persistent data storage.
